h1. Introduction

This project began as a learning tool I used to learn about SBT and deploying scala applications to Google App Engine.
The notes I was taking became the content of this application. So far I have writen up the following topics:

# DevelopmentEnvironment Installing the tools required to set up a development environment for writing applications with Scala, SBT, Intellij and App Engine.
# CreateProject Creating a new project with SBT and IntelliJ integration.
# SimpleWebApplication  Creating a simple web application and deploying it to the local development server.
# SomeScala Adding a scala servlet to the web application.
# IntroducingTextile Using textile to render HTML. Also provides an example of SBT`s dependency management.
# ServingMultiplePages Adding the ability to render multiple textile documents.
# CachingContent Using app engine`s MemCacheService API and HTTP etags to implement caching.
# DynamicContent Using app engine`s DataStoreService API to allow users to update content forming a basic wiki application.

Hopefully someone finds this useful. The code is available here:
